# RpiArduinoLapTimer

This is a major update to the Lap Timer in the other repository.
with EasyRaceLapTimer and OpenLap using a common protocol we will now use the same protocol and have support for more than come along

this version uses arduino's interrupts to get accurate lap times and raspberry Pi for hosting the website.
a raspberry pi zero or pi 1 or pi 2 should all work with this project.
for arduino a nano is recommended
